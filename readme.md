# AJAX User Registration System

A simple AJAX-based user registration system built with Node.js for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. This project demonstrates how to handle asynchronous form submissions using the Fetch API and manage user data in a mock database.


## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```sh
.
├── public/
│   ├── index.html     # Main form UI
│   ├── style.css      # Form styling
│   └── script.js      # AJAX handling logic
└── server.js          # Node.js backend
```
